I am here to tell you how your glass body complements your mirror soul 

How your skin, as delicate as the word love, sparkles under the slightest sun kiss

I am here to tell you how the world needs more of your light and How you are equally loved and needed in the darkest of your hours 

I am here to treasure you

I am here to show you the treasure you already possess I am here to bask under your light When a million suns yearn for a sight of my body I am here to tell you how you are worth forfeiting universes for I am here to tell you, in all truth

That you are enough

That you are more than enough

For anyone them or us 

You will always be enough.
