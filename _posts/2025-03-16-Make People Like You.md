# Section 3: Develop Rapport & Connection Fast 
## 9. Make People Like You
How to make people like you.

So this is one of my favorite videos because I have a technique that is really powerful and that will make people like you.

And with this technique, I have people who come to me and say, Oh, Alan, I really I really enjoy talking to you.

I don't know why, but I really liked it.

So I want to reveal this technique to you here in this video.

But before I would like to ask you a simple question, Can you just think about the news and everything horrible that is happening in the world right now?

How do you feel?

Maybe you are sad, maybe you are angry, or maybe you have another negative emotion.

And what if I ask you this question?

What are your passions and interests?

You may start thinking about them and really feel great.

So by the questions that I ask, I'm able to trigger certain emotions.

And I know that there are some people that would say, Oh, Allen, but when I watch the news, I feel great.

Yes, But I want to say is that there are certain questions that you can ask, and most of the time people will feel something that is great or something that is bad if you ask a positive question.

There are higher chances that the person will feel positive emotions and remember, people will remember how they felt in an interaction, not what was said in an interaction, because words are only 7%.

So if you ask a question that will make the other person feel great, that will make the other person have great emotions in their body.

They will love you for that because what most people do is that they approach and they don't really care about what they say.

They just say random things and they don't really care about making the other person comfortable and making the other person have great emotions.

So when I talk to people, I will always ask the positive questions such as What do you like to do for fun?

What are your passions and interests?

Where would you like to travel?

What would you like to do when you have free time?

I always ask them these positive questions because I know that there are higher chances that they will feel great emotions because let's say that we are talking about your passions.

How do you feel?

You feel great and you are generating these positive emotions, but then you will associate them to me.

Now, I wouldn't recommend that you approach someone and then you start asking these positive questions because saying, Hey, what are your passions and interests just after meeting someone?

Maybe that can be a little bit off or awkward or depending on the situation.

But what I encourage you to do is to approach someone and start with a conversation that is, I would say, basic small talk.

And then when you have built some connection with the person, you can start asking these positive questions.

In other words, it has to be questions that may trigger positive emotions in the other person's body.

I'm not saying to manipulate someone, I'm not saying, hey, manipulate someone and trigger certain emotion.

I'm just saying ask questions that has higher chances of having a great reaction rather than boring questions or negative oriented questions.

Because if you ask negative oriented questions, the person will feel negative feelings and the person won't say, Oh, I had a great time with this person.

Now it's different.

If you ask a negative question and the person listens, then you are sharing your problems.

That's a different and that's a different situation here.

I'm saying you are at a networking event.

You approach someone for the first time and you talk to them and that's how you will be able to become magnetic.

So I would like to ask you this question here.

What are three positive questions that you could have in your toolbox and that you could ask people when you meet them?

Maybe it can be about what they like to do when they have free time about their passions and interests.

It can be about travel.

It can be about anything that you think will trigger a positive emotion and start using that.

And this technique actually, I learned that from my best friend because I was observing him, you know, ten years ago.

I was shy.

I started, so I had no social skills.

But there is something I had.

It means that I could observe people.

So I was observing people and I observed my best friend and he would always ask questions that would stand out and that had a positive outcome because I was studying at university and most people would only talk about the exams, about the grades, about how difficult the course was.

And he would talk to people and talk about the vacation.

He would talk about something fun about the parties.

He was studying hard, but it's just that he was not talking about that.

He was just talking about positive things.

And what happened is that he became popular.

So it's up to you now to incorporate and to use a small questions, I would say small talk questions that can have a positive impact because remember, people will remember how they felt, not what was said.

So go ahead, take a piece of paper and write down right now three questions that you can ask people to trigger.

I would say that has higher chances of triggering positive emotions and then go out to the world and use them.
