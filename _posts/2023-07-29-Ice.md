# Ice
Deploy & hack into a Windows machine, exploiting a very poorly secured media server.

Kali Linux : 10.18.72.222

Target IP Address : 10.10.184.85

## Recon
Scan and enumerate our victim!

Deploy the machine! This may take up to three minutes to start.

Launch a scan against our target machine, I recommend using a SYN scan set to scan all ports on the machine. The scan command will be provided as a hint, however, it's recommended to complete the room 'Nmap' prior to this room. 

To perform a SYN scan on all ports of a target machine using Nmap (a popular network scanning tool), you can use the following command:

```
nmap -sS -p- <target_ip>
```

Let me break down the command:

- `nmap`: This is the command to execute Nmap.
- `-sS`: This option specifies a SYN scan, also known as a half-open scan. It sends SYN packets to the target ports to determine if they are open, closed, or filtered.
- `-p-`: This option tells Nmap to scan all 65535 TCP ports on the target machine. The dash (-) after `-p` means "all ports."
- `<target_ip>`: Replace this with the IP address of the machine you want to scan. For example, `10.10.19.228`.

Yes, there are several ways to speed up the Nmap scan to make it more efficient and faster. Here are some tips to speed up the scan:

1. Adjust the Timing Template: Nmap provides different timing templates that control the speed and aggressiveness of the scan. The default template is usually "Normal" (`-T3`). You can try using a faster timing template such as "Aggressive" (`-T4`) or "Insane" (`-T5`). Keep in mind that higher timing templates can be more aggressive and may increase the chances of being detected by intrusion detection systems (IDS) or firewalls.

   Example: `nmap -T4 -p- <target_ip>`

2. Specify Target Ports: Instead of scanning all 65535 TCP ports, you can focus on specific ports or a range of ports that are more likely to be open and interesting. This reduces the number of packets sent and shortens the scan time.

   Example: `nmap -p 1-1000 <target_ip>`

3. Parallel Scanning: Nmap supports parallel scanning, which allows you to scan multiple hosts in parallel or multiple ports on a single host simultaneously. This can significantly speed up the scanning process.

   Example for scanning multiple hosts: `nmap -T4 -F 192.168.1.100 192.168.1.101 192.168.1.102`

   Example for scanning multiple ports in parallel: `nmap -p 22,80,443 -T4 <target_ip>`

4. Disable DNS Resolution: By default, Nmap performs DNS resolution to determine hostnames for scanned IP addresses. If you don't need this information, you can disable DNS resolution to save time.

   Example: `nmap -T4 -p- --max-rtt-timeout 200ms --max-retries 1 -n <target_ip>`

5. Use Version Detection and Script Scanning Selectively: Nmap can perform version detection and run various scripts to gather more information about the target. However, these features can take additional time. Use them selectively based on your specific goals.

   Example for version detection: `nmap -sS -p- -sV <target_ip>`

   Example for script scanning: `nmap -sS -p- -sC <target_ip>`

Remember, while these techniques can speed up the scan, using aggressive scanning options might increase the chances of being detected and blocked by security systems. Always be mindful of the network you are scanning and ensure you have permission to conduct the scan on the target system. Unauthorized scanning is both unethical and illegal.

Once the scan completes, we'll see a number of interesting ports open on this machine. As you might have guessed, the firewall has been disabled (with the service completely shutdown), leaving very little to protect this machine. One of the more interesting ports that is open is Microsoft Remote Desktop (MSRDP). What port is this open on?

3389

What service did nmap identify as running on port 8000? (First word of this service)

Icecast

What does Nmap identify as the hostname of the machine? (All caps for the answer)

DARK-PC

## Gain Access
Exploit the target vulnerable service to gain a foothold!

Now that we've identified some interesting services running on our target machine, let's do a little bit of research into one of the weirder services identified: Icecast. Icecast, or well at least this version running on our target, is heavily flawed and has a high level vulnerability with a score of 7.5 (7.4 depending on where you view it). What type of vulnerability is it? Use https://www.cvedetails.com for this question and the next.

Question Hint: This type of vulnerability allows for an attacker to execute arbitrary code in an unauthenticated fashion. The name can be found listed at the 'Vulnerability Type' on https://www.cvedetails.com

execute code overflow

What is the CVE number for this vulnerability? This will be in the format: CVE-0000-0000

CVE-2004-1561

Now that we've found our vulnerability, let's find our exploit. For this section of the room, we'll use the Metasploit module associated with this exploit. Let's go ahead and start Metasploit using the command `msfconsole`

After Metasploit has started, let's search for our target exploit using the command 'search icecast'. What is the full path (starting with exploit) for the exploitation module? This module is also referenced in 'RP: Metasploit' which is recommended to be completed prior to this room, although not entirely necessary. 

exploit/windows/http/icecast_header

First let's check that the LHOST option is set to our tun0 IP (which can be found on the access page). With that done, let's set that last option to our target IP. Now that we have everything ready to go, let's run our exploit using the command `exploit`

## Escalate
Enumerate the machine and find potential privilege escalation paths to gain Admin powers!

Woohoo! We've gained a foothold into our victim machine! What's the name of the shell we have now?

Now that we know the architecture of the process, let's perform some further recon. While this doesn't work the best on x64 machines, let's now run the following command `run post/multi/recon/local_exploit_suggester`. *This can appear to hang as it tests exploits and might take several minutes to complete*

Running the local exploit suggester will return quite a few results for potential escalation exploits. What is the full path (starting with exploit/) for the first returned exploit?

exploit/windows/local/bypassuac_eventvwr

Now that we have an exploit in mind for elevating our privileges, let's background our current session using the command `background` or `CTRL + z`. Take note of what session number we have, this will likely be 1 in this case. We can list all of our active sessions using the command `sessions` when outside of the meterpreter shell.

```

```

Go ahead and select our previously found local exploit for use using the command `use FULL_PATH_FOR_EXPLOIT`

```

Now that we've set our session number, further options will be revealed in the options menu. We'll have to set one more as our listener IP isn't correct. What is the name of this option?

LHOST

Set this option now. You might have to check your IP on the TryHackMe network using the command `ip addr`

After we've set this last option, we can now run our privilege escalation exploit. Run this now using the command `run`. Note, this might take a few attempts and you may need to relaunch the box and exploit the service in the case that this fails. 

```

The `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege` is a security privilege in the Windows operating system that determines whether a user or process can take ownership of objects, such as files and directories, that they do not currently own. This privilege is one of several security settings that control user rights and permissions in Windows.

Taking ownership of an object grants the user or process the full control permissions on that object. With this privilege, a user or process can change permissions, modify or delete the object, and perform various administrative tasks.

Typically, administrators and certain privileged system processes have this privilege enabled by default. It allows them to perform essential tasks, such as modifying system files or accessing sensitive resources. Standard users, on the other hand, usually do not have this privilege to prevent unauthorized changes to critical system components.

Having the `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege` can be potentially dangerous, as it can lead to unauthorized access and modification of sensitive data if misused. Therefore, it is essential to restrict this privilege to trusted and authorized users or processes.

It is worth noting that proper access control and permission management are crucial for maintaining the security of a Windows system. Users and administrators should exercise caution when granting or modifying security privileges to prevent security breaches and maintain the integrity of the system.

## Looting
Learn how to gather additional credentials and crack the saved hashes on the machine.

Prior to further action, we need to move to a process that actually has the permissions that we need to interact with the lsass service, the service responsible for authentication within Windows. First, let's list the processes using the command `ps`. Note, we can see processes being run by NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM as we have escalated permissions (even though our process doesn't). 

```
meterpreter > ps

In order to interact with lsass we need to be 'living in' a process that is the same architecture as the lsass service (x64 in the case of this machine) and a process that has the same permissions as lsass. The printer spool service happens to meet our needs perfectly for this and it'll restart if we crash it! What's the name of the printer service?

spoolsv.exe

Mentioned within this question is the term 'living in' a process. Often when we take over a running program we ultimately load another shared library into the program (a dll) which includes our malicious code. From this, we can spawn a new thread that hosts our shell. 

Migrate to this process now with the command `migrate -N PROCESS_NAME`

```
meterpreter > migrate -N spoolsv.exe
[*] Migrating from 2456 to 1380...
[*] Migration completed successfully.
meterpreter > sysinfo

Let's check what user we are now with the command `getuid`. What user is listed?

NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM

Now that we've made our way to full administrator permissions we'll set our sights on looting. Mimikatz is a rather infamous password dumping tool that is incredibly useful. Load it now using the command `load kiwi` (Kiwi is the updated version of Mimikatz)

```
meterpreter > load kiwi

Success.
```

Loading kiwi into our meterpreter session will expand our help menu, take a look at the newly added section of the help menu now via the command `help`.

Which command allows up to retrieve all credentials?

creds_all

Run this command now. What is Dark's password? Mimikatz allows us to steal this password out of memory even without the user 'Dark' logged in as there is a scheduled task that runs the Icecast as the user 'Dark'. It also helps that Windows Defender isn't running on the box ;) (Take a look again at the ps list, this box isn't in the best shape with both the firewall and defender disabled)

## Post-Exploitation
Explore post-exploitation actions we can take on Windows.

Before we start our post-exploitation, let's revisit the help menu one last time in the meterpreter shell. We'll answer the following questions using that menu.

What command allows us to dump all of the password hashes stored on the system? We won't crack the Administrative password in this case as it's pretty strong (this is intentional to avoid password spraying attempts)

hashdump

```
Priv: Password database Commands
================================

    Command       Description
    -------       -----------
    hashdump      Dumps the contents of the SAM database
```

While more useful when interacting with a machine being used, what command allows us to watch the remote user's desktop in real time?

screenshare

```
Stdapi: User interface Commands
===============================
    Command       Description
    -------       -----------
    screenshare   Watch the remote user desktop in real time
```

How about if we wanted to record from a microphone attached to the system?

record_mic

```
Stdapi: Webcam Commands
=======================

    Command       Description
    -------       -----------
    record_mic    Record audio from the default microphone for X seconds
```

To complicate forensics efforts we can modify timestamps of files on the system. What command allows us to do this? Don't ever do this on a pentest unless you're explicitly allowed to do so! This is not beneficial to the defending team as they try to breakdown the events of the pentest after the fact.

timestomp

```
Priv: Timestomp Commands
========================

    Command       Description
    -------       -----------
    timestomp     Manipulate file MACE attributes
```

Mimikatz allows us to create what's called a `golden ticket`, allowing us to authenticate anywhere with ease. What command allows us to do this?

Golden ticket attacks are a function within Mimikatz which abuses a component to Kerberos (the authentication system in Windows domains), the ticket-granting ticket. In short, golden ticket attacks allow us to maintain persistence and authenticate as any user on the domain.

golden_ticket_create

```
Kiwi Commands
=============

    Command       Description
    -------       -----------
    golden_ticke  Create a golden kerberos ticket
    t_create
```

One last thing to note. As we have the password for the user 'Dark' we can now authenticate to the machine and access it via remote desktop (MSRDP). As this is a workstation, we'd likely kick whatever user is signed onto it off if we connect to it, however, it's always interesting to remote into machines and view them as their users do. If this hasn't already been enabled, we can enable it via the following Metasploit module: `run post/windows/manage/enable_rdp`

```
meterpreter > run post/windows/manage/enable_rdp

[*] Enabling Remote Desktop
[*]     RDP is already enabled
[*] Setting Terminal Services service startup mode
[*]     The Terminal Services service is not set to auto, changing it to auto ...
[*]     Opening port in local firewall if necessary
[*] For cleanup execute Meterpreter resource file: /root/.msf4/loot/20230729082734_default_10.10.184.85_host.windows.cle_785848.txt

```

## Extra Credit
Explore manual exploitation via exploit code found on exploit-db. 

Exploit link: https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/568

As you advance in your pentesting skills, you will be faced eventually with exploitation without the usage of Metasploit. Provided above is the link to one of the exploits found on Exploit DB for hijacking Icecast for remote code execution. While not required by the room, it's recommended to attempt exploitation via the provided code or via another similar exploit to further hone your skills.
