# Section 3: Develop Rapport & Connection Fast
## 10. Attractive Social Energy
Hi, so in this video here, I would like to talk to you about how you could have an attractive social energy because remember, words are only seven percent and 93 percent is the non-verbal.

It means that there is your voice, your eye contact, your body language.

And it's really important to focus on the emotions that you feel.

Why?

Because if you feel confident, you will appear as confident and you will have a body language that will be confident if you are, for example, sad or depressed, your body language, your voice intonation, your eye contact will be according to what you are feeling.

So it's really important if you want to become socially successful, to take care of how you feel.

Now, I'm not saying to be happy and to be positive all the time.

I'm not saying that if sometimes you are sad and depressed, it's okay to be sad and depressed because we are human.

But what I want to say is that if most of the time when you approach people, you don't take care of how you feel, then it will be difficult for you to be socially successful or you will be only attracting people who are negative and depressed.

So what I encourage you to do is to really take care of how you feel.

And the secret that I would like to share with you here is that most people never take care of how they feel.

They don't basically people said:

Alan, I applied your advice in what to say, how to approach someone.

But people don't like me.

I don't know why.

And then when I see this person approaching, they are dead inside.

They have no emotion.

They are sad, depressed and : Alan.

I don't understand why I don't have social success.

It's because the person is not feeling great for the secret I would like to share with you here is that before going to a social place, I would like you to listen to some music, to just put yourself in a great state and you will start by doing that.

And then I would like you to close your eyes for three seconds and just remember a positive memory, because if you remember a positive memory, you will be able to access these positive emotions.

So if you do that just before going to a social place, you are in your car, you are walking you at home, you just close your eyes.

And you remember a positive memory and you really feel these emotions in your body, you feel them, and then when you start feeling these emotions, you just expend them through your body.

And as you can see in doing that, and you can see already that my energy level has changed, you see the more powerful, more happy.

I'm happier and I have a better energy.

Now, just by doing that for a few seconds.

Now, what happens if now I go in, I approach people, I will become charismatic and magnetic.

So you can also do that.

You also have this power.

So I would like you to just do this exercise right now.

Just stand up.

And when you stand up, I would like you just to close your eyes for a few seconds.

And when you do that, I would like you to remember a happy memory and really feel the memory to immerse yourself, close your eyes and imagine the memory.

Who was there with you?

What did you feel were the only sounds?

Was there any smell?

What was there and you will try to relive the experience and then when you get this emotion of being happy and positive, I would like you to expand it.

And you do that.

You are doing that at home, I hope, or somewhere that you can really do this exercise first.

It can be difficult to access this emotion, but if you practice that over and over again, you will be able to do like me in a few seconds to just close your eyes and access this emotion really quickly.

So the more you practice is exercise, the easier it will be.

What you can also do is when you are interacting with someone.

Just for a few seconds, for a few seconds, you just focus on something great, something great that happened that day or something that you are grateful for.

In a few seconds and you will see that you will be able to really access this positive energy.

So to just show you an example.

Now I'm talking to you and I'm really being grateful.

So I'm thinking about great things that happened to me today.

You see that my energy is really positive and outgoing.

And I hope that you would like to interact with me right now.

But now, if I think about something really sad and about something that makes me depressed, you can see how my body language changes my tone of voice and you see how I'm talking a little bit slower.

And I don't really know.

And I don't really think that you would like to hang out with me right now.

And what has changed is just my social energy.

And you can see in a few seconds I'm able to recreate this social energy that is attractive.

How?

By just focusing on a memory that is happy.

So I would like you to practice and try to practice at home.

You go from one state of happiness to depressed, happiness, depressed, happiness, depressed.

And how do you do that?

You change your focus because that will give you the emotions that are inside you is what you focus on, to focus on something that is really positive.

And you will see that it will be easier for you to interact with people.

Also, something that I do and I encourage you to do is to practice gratitude daily.

So every day when you wake up, you take a piece of paper and a pen and you just write down what you are grateful for, what you are grateful for.

You have a roof, you have food, you have water.

You have people who love you.

You have that in your life.

You have that, that, that.

And then you really feel this emotion because the more you are used to feeling these great emotions of gratitude, happiness, the easier it will be to trigger them.

And then when you are in a social situation, you will be able just to think about the memory or about what you are grateful for and the emotion will enter your body.

So that was it for the social attractive energy.

Now, I just would like to share a concept that is a little bit more advanced that I use when I really need to make a first impression.

So it's a little bit more advanced.

So if you don't want to use it, that's OK.

When I'm talking to someone, I would imagine that there is a bandwidth between us and I will imagine that there is a bandwidth and I would imagine that the bandwidth is opening.

So I will imagine a bandwidth that is like that.

And then I will put myself in a great state, feel great emotions, and then I will imagine that I'm throwing the positive energy at you.

And then what will happen as I have opened this bandwidth that I'm just imagining I am throwing these positive emotions, you will be able to feel them and then you would associate these positive emotions to me.

So it's something that's a little bit more advanced that you can do.

Again, you just imagine that there is a bandwidth between you two.

You open it and you are still imagining that in your mind and then you feel great.

You put yourself in state and then you throw the energy at them, the great energy.

OK, so this is more advanced.

Why?

Because you must be able to really access the state of happiness and being positive really, really quickly.

So that was it for the attractive energy practice entering this positive state.

And you will see that people will really love you and they won't understand why, because everything is about energy and about the body language.

It's about the 93 percent of the nonverbal.

1. **Nurture Positive Emotions**  
   - Because nonverbal cues (tone, posture, facial expressions) dominate communication, focus on how you *feel* before and during interactions.  
   - If you enter a social situation feeling genuinely upbeat, you’ll naturally project confidence and warmth.

2. **Use “Positive State” Exercises**  
   - **Recall a Happy Memory**: Close your eyes, relive a joyful experience, and let those emotions fill you.  
   - **Practice Shifting Moods**: Alternate between a happy thought and a sad thought to learn how to quickly access a positive state in conversation.

3. **Leverage Gratitude**  
   - Make gratitude a daily habit: jot down things you’re thankful for.  
   - The more you train yourself to feel good, the easier it becomes to tap into those emotions on demand.

4. **Advanced “Energy Bandwidth” Visualization** *(Optional)*  
   - Imagine a “bandwidth” or channel between you and the other person.  
   - Feel your positive energy, then envision sending it to them through this channel.  
   - This helps them sense (and associate you with) those upbeat vibes.

By focusing on genuine positivity—through memory, gratitude, or visualization exercises—you project an *attractive social energy* that draws people in and makes them enjoy your company.
